On a quest to learn

Hello:

Christopher John Billings here, I like using C# and Visual Studio. I was introduced to it at my job a couple of years ago. We created an application to track attendance.
I was fascinated by the code, the possiblities, and opportunites. 
I love learning and I am here to learn as much as I can and beyond.
